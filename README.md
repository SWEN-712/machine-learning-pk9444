# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_ML

## Description 
This is the second project for the SWEN 712 - Software Engineering Accessibility course based on ML. In this project, we use Sentiment Analysis to analyze the first 1000 tweets from the twitter handle of NV Access, who developed NVDA for accessibility for the blind. We use the following libraries to achieve our objective: 

### Libraries 
tweepy- to get the tweets from the NV Access Twitter Handle 
textblob - to make use of sentiment analysis functionalties like getting the sentiment polarity scores and classifying the tweets according to it 
matplotlib - to better visualize our results in the form of a pie chart as an added functionality 

## Requirments

- Python 3.8 or above (we need inbuilt unicode)
- Windows or Linux OS 
- a valid twitter handle 
- Twitter Dev Account 
- Consumer Key and Token 
- Secret Access Key and Token (generated from Twitter Dev)
